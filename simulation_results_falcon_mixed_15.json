On the one hand, it has helped to reduce carbon emissions, as cleaner production is incentivized. On another, it's been challenging to cope financially, with the additional costs falling heavily on low-incomed households.\nIn light of these challenges, we suggest that the EU consider the following changes to its Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism: 1) Exempt essential goods and services, such as healthcare and childcare, to avoid further financial burden on households; 2) Develop a compensation mechanism to support households in transition, helping them to adapt and invest in cleaner energy and technologies; 3) Explore ways to harmonize the carbon price across the EU to avoid unfair competition and ensure a level playing field.",

We would like to see the final design of the tax refined and clarified, as there are some aspects that are unclear to us. Additionally, we would like the tax to be applied only to certain imported goods, so that it does not inadvertently increase the price of other, domestically produced goods. We believe that the tax should be applied at the border, and not further down the production chain, to avoid possible unintended consequences.\nIn conclusion, we believe that a Carbon Boundary Adjusted Taxes is a feasible policy option to reduce carbon emissions and production costs. The design of this tax will determine its success, and it is our hope that the",

However, I would like to suggest some improvements and clarifications to the proposal. First, the proposal should be more transparent, as it is difficult to understand how the tax would work in practice. Second, it should be designed in a way that avoids double taxation of EU companies. Third, the revenue collected should be used wisely, as the EU needs to invest in sustainable energy and environmental protection.\nGiven these considerations, I am ready to work with the Commission to refine the proposed policy, in order to make it as effective and efficient as possible.",

We are also concerned that the policy may have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nAs a result, we would like to suggest a few changes to this proposal. First, we recommend that the Commission consider other options, such as the introduction of a carbon tax, to achieve a more significant impact on carbon emissions. This would also help make the tax more transparent and easier to administer.\nSecondly, we suggest that the proposal should be more specific on which carbon intensive products are to be taxed. We believe that this would help reduce the uncertainty for businesses that may have to adjust their operations to comply with the tax.\nFinally, we appreciate that the EU is taking steps to address climate change, and we are willing to contribute our efforts in this regard.

We would like to see a simpler, more efficient tax code that takes into account the modern realities of the economy. This would include lowering the top income tax rate, closing corporate tax loopholes, and reducing the estate tax. We also support the idea of increasing the standard deduction to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize their deductions. \n####\n#### \nWhat is your opinion on the current proposal?

By focusing on short-term compliance, we may miss out on significant opportunities for growth and product development. To strike a better balance between compliance and innovation, I propose that we allocate a portion of our resources to researching and developing sustainable technologies.\nIn conclusion, while I understand that the current stance is well thought out and aims to achieve long-lasting environmental responsibility, I believe that there are alternative strategies and opportunities that could be explored to further align with company values and contribute to a more sustainable future.",
