However, we would like to highlight that additional costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, as the majority of our daily necessities are imported from other countries. In the long run, this could lead to a reduction in the purchasing power of our already limited budget. Consequently, it may lead to an increase in prices, making it harder to maintain the current standard of living.\n\nGiven the above, we believe that the policy should be more tailored to protect low- and middle-income households. For instance, an increase of the VAT rate on carbon-dense goods could be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in carbon duties to offset the increased tax burden. Moreover, a more selective approach should be adopted, focusing on the carbon-critical sectors, while exempting the less carbon-sensitive ones. This would help to minimize the impact on households that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nIn conclusion, while the Carbon Carbon Border Mechanism is a step in the right direction, it should be further refined to better protect low and middle income households from additional costs.",

Our intended actions include exploring alternative mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, that could be more effective in reducing carbon leakage, while maintaining competitiveness.\nTo summarize, while the current Carbon BackStop is a step in the right direction, it may not go far enough to address the issue of carbon emission leakage.

Secondly, it may create a carbon price inversion, causing industries in non.EU countries to become less competitive. In the long run, this could lead them to decrease their production, which would be detrimental to the environment.\n\nTo address these concerns, we suggest incorporating a carbon-intensity threshold to the Carbon Backstrop policy. This would ensure that it only applies to carbon-heavy industries, reducing the risk of unintended consequences. Additionally, we propose that the EU consider alternative methods, such as emissions trading or carbon taxes, to achieve its climate targets, as the current approach may not be sufficient in the long term.\nIn conclusion, while the current policy is a step towards addressing carbon leakage and achieving cleaner energy, we believe that it could be refined to better align with our company's sustainability goals.",

We therefore suggest simplifying the reporting and compliance requirements to minimize the administrative burden on businesses.\nSecond, we recognize that the policy may create uncertainties for certain markets.

The policy is a step in the right direction, and it is a welcome change. However, there are certain elements of the policy that may not align with our company's goals, and as such, we would like to suggest a few revisions.\n\nFirst, the current policy limits the development of renewable energy projects to a maximum capacity of 2.5 MW per state. This is too restrictive, as it may hinder the growth of smaller, innovative renewable energy companies. We would like the policy to be revised to allow for projects of all sizes.\nSecond, the policy currently offers incentives for projects that are developed on landfills. This may lead to the development and deployment of unneeded and unsustainable projects. We suggest removing this incentive to encourage more projects that focus on the development renewable energy on previously developed lands.\nThird, the existing policy does not provide enough support for the development projects. While the policy offers a range of financial incentives, it lacks a clear definition of the types of renewable resources that are eligible for these incentives. We recommend adding more clarity to the incentives, so that projects focusing on solar and wind energy can be better supported.\nFinally, the new policy could be improved by including more transparency and accountability measures. This would help ensure that the incentives are being used correctly and that the projects being supported are of the highest quality.\nWe appreciate",
