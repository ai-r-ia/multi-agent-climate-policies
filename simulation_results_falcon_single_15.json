My family and I have been practicing sustainable habits for a while now, and we are committed to continuing these practices. \n\nWe appreciate the introduction of the recycling program, as it allows us to earn some extra money from old electronics. However, we find it challenging to separate the recyclables, and sometimes end up throwing away recyclable materials. I suggest providing clear labels and guidelines on how to sort recyclables to ensure that we can participate more effectively.\n\nRegarding the proposed tax on single-use plastics, we understand the intention behind it. However; we are concerned that it may impact the working poor more than necessary, as we already spend a larger percentage of our income on essential items. We suggest considering alternative methods for raising revenue that would not disproportionately affect those in lower income brackets.\nIn conclusion, we appreciate the proposal's intention to reduce environmental impact. However we suggest considering the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed policy, as well as alternative methods that may not disproportionately impact those in low-incomes brackets. Thank you for taking the time to read our feedback.\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",

To achieve this, I suggest we allow multiple instances for the same program. This will allow those who are unable to attend the first instance to have an opportunity to participate later.\n\n2. Provide a Mechanism to Prioritize Attendance:\nThe feedback I've received suggests that it would be beneficial to prioritize those who haven't had the chance yet to attend. To implement this, we can allocate a specific number of tickets or spots for those interested in attending the event but were unable to do it during the initial registration period. This way, those who genuinely want to attend can have a better chance of being selected.\nRevised Policy:\n1) Allow for up to three instances of a program.\n2) Implement a mechanism for prioritizing attendance, such as a lottery system or a waitlist.",

While this is a valid concern, I believe we can still achieve our goal of providing value to our members without overburdening them with costs. One potential solution is to implement a ticketing system for our events, with a maximum cap on the number of tickets available for each event. This would allow us to ensure that our members are able to attend without incurring excessive costs. \n\nSecondly, I recognize that our current registration system at the borrowing and registration desk may not be the most efficient. To address this, I suggest implementing an online registration system for members, which would not only reduce the cost of processing physical registration forms but would also increase the accuracy of data collection. \n- As a small company, I would recommend that we consider implementing an electronic registration system to streamline the process.
